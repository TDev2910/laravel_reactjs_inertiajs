Laravel + ReactJS + InertiaJS Integration
This project demonstrates how to integrate ReactJS into a Laravel application using InertiaJS, allowing for a modern single-page application (SPA) experience without building a separate REST API.

Features
ReactJS Integration via InertiaJS
Using InertiaJS to connect Laravel (backend) with React (frontend) in a seamless monolith.

Layout System (Default Layout)
Shared layout component using Main.jsx, rendering consistent UI across all pages.

Props Passing Mechanism
Pass server-side data from Laravel to React components using Inertia::render() and usePage().props.

Users CRUD
Create, Read, Update, and Delete users using Inertia-powered forms.

Form Validation
Backend Laravel validation with automatic error sharing to the frontend.

Redirects & Navigation
Use Laravel route redirects and <Link> components from Inertia React for smooth SPA navigation.

Flash Messages
Flash messages (e.g., "User created successfully!") shared from Laravel to React and displayed in the UI.

Pagination
Server-side pagination using Laravel's paginate() and React rendering of pagination links.

No Need for API
All interactions happen through standard Laravel routes and controllers â€” no separate REST API is required.
